(** This module represents a local cache. *)

val clean_cachedir : string -> unit
(** [clean_cachedir dir] clean the specified cache directory. *)

type t
(** The abstract data type. *)

val create : directory:string -> t
(** Create the abstract type. *)

val cache_of_name : t -> string -> Index.arch -> Utils.revision -> string
(** [cache_of_name t name arch revision] return the filename
    of the cached file.  (Note: It doesn't check if the filename
    exists, this is just a simple string transformation). *)

val is_cached : t -> string -> Index.arch -> Utils.revision -> bool
(** [is_cached t name arch revision] return whether the file with
    specified name, architecture and revision is cached. *)

val print_item_status : t -> header:bool -> (string * Index.arch * Utils.revision) list -> unit
(** [print_item_status t header items] print the status in the cache
    of the specified items (which are tuples of name, architecture,
    and revision).

    If [~header:true] then display a header with the path of the
    cache. *)
