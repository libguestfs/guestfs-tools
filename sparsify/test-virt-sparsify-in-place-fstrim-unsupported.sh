# Test that we do the right thing for filesystems where the fstrim
# operation is not supported.
#
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1364347
#
# This test assumes that the kernel minix driver does not support
# fstrim.  It might become supported in a future kernel version in
# which case we could use a different filesystem for this test, or
# delete the test if we are confident that all common filesystems are
# supported.
