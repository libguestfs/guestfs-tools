        <description>Authselect is designed to be a replacement for authconfig but it takes
a different approach to configure the system. Instead of letting
the administrator build the PAM stack with a tool (which may potentially
end up with a broken configuration), it would ship several tested stacks
(profiles) that solve a use-case and are well tested and supported.
At the same time, some obsolete features of authconfig are not
supported by authselect.</description>

        <summary>A GNU archiving program</summary>
        <description>GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive.  Archives
are files which contain a collection of other files plus information
about them, such as their file name, owner, timestamps, and access
permissions.  The archive can be another file on the disk, a magnetic
tape, or a pipe.  GNU cpio supports the following archive formats:  binary,
old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1
tar.  By default, cpio creates binary format archives, so that they are
compatible with older cpio programs.  When it is extracting files from
archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of archive it is reading
and can read archives created on machines with a different byte-order.

Install cpio if you need a program to manage file archives.</description>

        <summary>A password-checking library</summary>
        <description>CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certain
security-oriented characteristics, with the purpose of stopping users
from choosing passwords that are easy to guess. CrackLib performs
several tests on passwords: it tries to generate words from a username
and gecos entry and checks those words against the password; it checks
for simplistic patterns in passwords; and it checks for the password
in a dictionary.

CrackLib is actually a library containing a particular C function
which is used to check the password, as well as other C
functions. CrackLib is not a replacement for a passwd program; it must
be used in conjunction with an existing passwd program.

Install the cracklib package if you need a program to check users'
passwords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you install
CrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.</description>

compares two files and shows the differences, line by line.  The cmp
command shows the offset and line numbers where two files differ, or
cmp can show the characters that differ between the two files.  The
diff3 command shows the differences between three files.  Diff3 can be
used when two people have made independent changes to a common
original; diff3 can produce a merged file that contains both sets of
changes and warnings about conflicts.  The sdiff command can be used
to merge two files interactively.

Install diffutils if you need to compare text files.</description>

large operands. GNU MP is fast because it uses fullwords as the basic
arithmetic type, it uses fast algorithms, it carefully optimizes
assembly code for many CPUs' most common inner loops, and it generally
emphasizes speed over simplicity/elegance in its operations.

Install the gmp package if you need a fast arbitrary precision
library.</description>

        <summary>A portable foreign function interface library</summary>
        <description>Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the &quot;calling convention&quot;.
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.</description>

The library does not implement any cipher algorithms.  All consumer
requests are sent to the kernel for processing.  Results from the
kernel crypto API are returned to the consumer via the library API.

The kernel interface and therefore this library can be used by
unprivileged processes.</description>

        <summary>SELinux library and simple utilities</summary>
        <description>Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux® kernel and a number
of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
Control, and Multi-level Security.

libselinux provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux API.</description>

        <description>This is the universally unique ID library, part of util-linux.

The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
id's (UUID's).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
across a network.

        <description>libverto provides a way for libraries to expose asynchronous interfaces
without having to choose a particular event loop, offloading this
decision to the end application which consumes the library.

If you are packaging an application, not library, based on libverto,
you should depend either on a specific implementation module or you
can depend on the virtual provides 'libverto-module-base'. This will
ensure that you have at least one module installed that provides io,
timeout and signal functionality. Currently glib is the only module
that does not provide these three because it lacks signal. However,
glib will support signal in the future.</description>

        <summary>Extended crypt library for descrypt, md5crypt, bcrypt, and others</summary>
        <description>libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports a wide variety of both modern and historical hashing methods:
yescrypt, gost-yescrypt, scrypt, bcrypt, sha512crypt, sha256crypt,
md5crypt, SunMD5, sha1crypt, NT, bsdicrypt, bigcrypt, and descrypt.
It provides the traditional Unix crypt and crypt_r interfaces, as well
as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by Openwall Linux, crypt_rn,
crypt_ra, crypt_gensalt, crypt_gensalt_rn, and crypt_gensalt_ra.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human. It is not suitable
for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any other situation
where speed is more important than careful handling of sensitive data.
However, it is intended to be fast and lightweight enough for use in
servers that must field thousands of login attempts per minute.

This version of the library does not provide the legacy API functions
that have been provided by glibc's libcrypt.so.1.</description>

        <summary>Perl-compatible regular expression library</summary>
        <description>PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular
expression) library to provide an entirely new API.

PCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of
functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one
for the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for
the 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++
wrappers. This package provides support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8
encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.

The distribution does contain a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit
library that are based on the POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix
man page). These can be found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that
this just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions
themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is
restricted, and does not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.</description>

provides a repetitive update of the statuses of running processes.
The free command displays the amounts of free and used memory on your
system. The skill command sends a terminate command (or another
specified signal) to a specified set of processes. The snice
command is used to change the scheduling priority of specified
processes. The tload command prints a graph of the current system
load average to a specified tty. The uptime command displays the
current time, how long the system has been running, how many users
are logged on, and system load averages for the past one, five,
and fifteen minutes. The w command displays a list of the users
who are currently logged on and what they are running. The watch
program watches a running program. The vmstat command displays
virtual memory statistics about processes, memory, paging, block
I/O, traps, and CPU activity. The pwdx command reports the current
working directory of a process or processes. The pidwait command
waits for processes of specified names.</description>

        <description>Python 3.10 is an accessible, high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted
programming language, designed with an emphasis on code readability.
It includes an extensive standard library, and has a vast ecosystem of
third-party libraries.

The python3 package provides the &quot;python3&quot; executable: the reference
interpreter for the Python language, version 3.
The majority of its standard library is provided in the python3-libs package,
which should be installed automatically along with python3.
The remaining parts of the Python standard library are broken out into the
python3-tkinter and python3-test packages, which may need to be installed
separately.

Documentation for Python is provided in the python3-docs package.

Packages containing additional libraries for Python are generally named with
the &quot;python3-&quot; prefix.</description>

        <description>systemd is a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest
of the system. It provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket
and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of
daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount
and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based
service control logic. systemd supports SysV and LSB init scripts and works as a
replacement for sysvinit. Other parts of this package are a logging daemon,
utilities to control basic system configuration like the hostname, date, locale,
maintain a list of logged-in users, system accounts, runtime directories and
settings, and a logging daemons.

This package was built from the 251.1-stable branch of systemd.</description>
