The C<script> module lets you run arbitrary shell scripts or programs
against the guest.

Note this feature requires FUSE support.  You may have to enable
this in your host, for example by adding the current user to the
C<fuse> group, or by loading a kernel module.

Use one or more I<--script> parameters to specify scripts or programs
that will be run against the guest.

The script or program is run with its current directory being the
guest’s root directory, so relative paths should be used.  For
example: C<rm etc/resolv.conf> in the script would remove a Linux
guest’s DNS configuration file, but C<rm /etc/resolv.conf> would
(try to) remove the host’s file.

Normally a temporary mount point for the guest is used, but you
can choose a specific one by using the I<--scriptdir> parameter.

B<Note:> This is different from I<--firstboot> scripts (which run
in the context of the guest when it is booting first time).
I<--script> scripts run on the host, not in the guest.");
